This directory contains some files from the Emacs/W3 (web browser for
emacs). Only files used by doxymacs.el are included. So if w3 is not
installed, doxymacs can use those files.

Versions
w3       : 4.0pre.47
doxymacs : 1.5.0

To use it put something like

; if the w3 package is not installed use the minimal version from
; ~/site-lisp/w3_minimal (only files used by doxymacs.el)
(if (and (eq (locate-library "url") nil)
         (file-accessible-directory-p "~/site-lisp/w3_minimal"))
    (setq load-path (append '("~/site-lisp/w3_minimal") load-path)))

in your .emacs
